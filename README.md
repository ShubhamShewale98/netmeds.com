netmeds Project
In this blog, I will be telling about our experience of the project at Masai School during construct week. We were asked to clone the website of Netmeds an online health store. We were a team of 7 members Balu Saikumar, Shubham Ramesh Shewale, Mohd Haroon Qureshi, Bigyan Kumar Sandilya, Priyanshu Kumar, and Vaibhav Panchave.
It was a very long week and we learn lots of new stuff, techniques during this period. And during testing before submission, it was really worth the efforts cloning the website.
About Netmeds.com
Netmeds is one of the top online pharmacies in India that deals with a wide range of healthcare products like high-quality prescription medicines, over-the-counter pharmaceuticals, general health care products, Ayurvedic medicines, and homeopathic medicines.
Our Experience
Being a team of 7 members we needed lots of zooms meets to clear doubts which were very fun but also we faced lots of difficulties and went through lots of issues while cloning the website. We struggled a lot but at last, we managed to design as we planned.

Problem faced during construct week
As this was the first big project we were building, we faced problems like using git, adjusting to using zoom, etc but in very little time we all managed to use them correctly. We had some minor issues while getting together the codes but we were able to fix those with proper communication and guidance from our instructor Chandra Sekhar and our IAâ€™s.
Thank You
